## 👩‍💻 Meet Team EATTT

We are **EATTT**, a dynamic team of five tech enthusiasts: **E**velyn, **A**ngela, **T**an Xin Tian, **T**eoh Xin Yee, and **T**oh Shee Thong. Our team name is a unique acronym made by combining the **first letters of our names**, representing the spirit of unity, creativity, and collaboration.

Although it might look like we're all about food (we know what you're thinking!), **EATTT** is actually a symbol of how we "consume" challenges and "digest" innovative solutions. Each letter stands for a member who's bringing their own flavor of skills and ideas into this project — working together, learning together, and building something great.

Stay tuned — we’re cooking up something awesome (okay, maybe just a tiny food pun 😄)!

### 📊 Phase 2 – User Analysis and Task Analysis

As part of the second phase, we conducted **persona development**, **scenario-based analysis**, and **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)** to understand real-world user pain points.

 **🔎 Personas**

- **Benny (Student)**: Prioritizes promotions and speed. Struggles with missing voucher info and unclear promotions.  
- **Dr. Aisha (Lecturer)**: Needs verified halal vegetarian food but faces trouble due to the lack of dietary filters.  
- **Puan Siti (Vendor)**: Wants to promote her food effectively, but her offers and dietary tags don’t display properly.

**📌 Core Tasks Analyzed**

1. **Order Food** 
   - Manual scrolling to find deals  
   - No upfront voucher validation  
   - No combined filters (e.g., halal + vegetarian)

2. **Monitor and Manage Order Status**  
   - Delayed or vague updates  
   - Ineffective support chatbot  
   - Deeply buried help functions

3. **Upload Menu (Vendor)**  
   - No dietary tags like "vegetarian"  
   - Promotion bugs cause dish visibility loss  
   - Unclear or ineffective technical support

🧠 **Key Findings**

- Filtering and promotion tools are inefficient for users in a rush  
- Help functions and chatbot are inaccessible and unresponsive  
- Vendors are frustrated by system limitations and bugs  
- Lack of dietary options directly affects food selection and vendor sales


 🎯 **Proposed Design Requirements**

To improve usability for both customers and vendors, we propose:

- ✅ **Smart filters**: Combine tags like halal + vegetarian + under RM10  
- ✅ **Voucher clarity**: Preview usable vouchers before checkout  
- ✅ **Persistent and contextual help**: Help button available on every screen    
- ✅ **Structured vendor tagging**: Add dietary and deal-related tags during upload  
- ✅ **Stable promotions**: Ensure promoted items are visible and trackable  
- ✅ **Transparent tracking**: Real-time rider status and detailed delay reasons

### 🍱Phase 4 - Prototyping and Evaluation
In Project Part 4, we will conduct prototyping and evaluation of our proposed system. We will be designing a high fidelity prototype that is able to handle all three tasks.

The prototyping and evaluation phase of our food delivery application, **EATTT**, was conducted on three different timelines in campus UTM. The prototype was developed using Figma to create high-fidelity interactive mockups. User testing was conducted on a laptop to simulate real-world interaction for the app’s intended platform. Test sessions were recorded using screen-recording software such as OBS Studio to document user interactions and verbal feedback.

The testing focused on three core tasks: 
1. 🔍 Ordering food with dietary filters
2. 🚚 Monitoring order status in real-time
3. 📤 Uploading new restaurant menu

These tasks were selected to address user pain points that identified earlier, such as lack of detailed filter for promotions, lack of transparency in delivery tracking and lack of dietary filtering options. For evaluation, we interviewed a total of 3 users in order to discover if there is any weakness and strengths of our prototype.

### Breifing Notes 
This application “EATTT” is a food delivery system designed specifically for the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) community, including students, staff, and food vendors. Its main purpose is to help users easily order meals that suit their preferences and dietary needs, track and manage their orders in real-time, and allow vendors to upload and promote their menus effectively. The system addresses common issues found in existing delivery platforms, such as unclear food labeling, limited filtering options (e.g., no halal + vegetarian combo), hidden vouchers only shown at checkout, poor delivery tracking, and unhelpful support chatbots. For vendors, the app also resolves issues like missing dietary tags and disappearing promotions. During this test, you’ll try out a few realistic tasks based on common user scenarios. We’re not testing you—we are testing the design. Please feel free to think aloud and give honest feedback. Your input is crucial for helping us improve the user experience.

Task 1: Select filter “Free delivery” or tag “Halal” + “Vegetarian”, then order 1 potato wedges from Lemon Tree store.

Task 2: Track the delivery of the order and access to the chatbot if faced any problems.

Task 3: Upload menu and apply promotion for the menu.

✅The user was attracted by the activity interface due to its layout and the straightforward navigation. The chatbot button in the bottom-right corner allows the user to immediately access the chatbot so he can know the sales. 

⚠️Nevertheless, he pointed out a usability issue regarding the lack of clear guidance for certain interactive elements. Specifically, there was no visual cue or instruction indicating that tapping the order box would lead to real-time tracking or chatbot access. While this was not a barrier for him personally, he acknowledged that first-time users might overlook this function.

<br>

**🔹 Task 3: Upload Menu & Apply Promotion**

**3️⃣ User 3**
1. User received the task and understood the requirements clearly.

7. User accessed the homepage again and entered the “Promotion” page.
8. User chose the “Free Delivery” promotion for Aglio Olio.
9. User completed the task.
   
✅He was impressed by the “Promotion” page as he could apply the promotion for all food with just only one button “Select All”. 

⚠️Nonetheless, the user gave feedback that the button for the type of food section is too small and can be adjusted larger so it would be easier to click the button.

<br>

### 🧠 Findings
**🔹 Task 1: Filter Selection and Food Ordering** 

**1️⃣ User 1** <br>
The usability issue identified in the interface is that the filter button located  at the main page is not immediately recognizable to users due to its use of a fries menu icon. It is typically associated with a menu rather than a filtering function. This lack of clarity can lead to user confusion and missed functionality, as users may overlook the option to filter food offers or categories. 

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to replace the fries icon with a more intuitive filter icon, such as a funnel symbol, which users commonly associate with filtering. Additionally, adding a label like “Filter” can make its purpose clear. This improvement would support better discoverability and improve the overall user experience by making key functions easier to access.

<br>

**2️⃣ User 2** <br>
The usability issue identified in the interface is at the restaurant main menu page. The "add" button, represented by a small blue plus icon next to each food item, appears too small and lacks visual emphasis. This can make it difficult for users, especially those using smaller devices or with limited dexterity. For this reason, they might not accurately tap the button, potentially leading to missed selections or frustration.

To improve usability, it is recommended to increase the size of the button to meet standard touch target guidelines and enhance its visibility with a more prominent color or background. As a result, it can improve accessibility and encourage smoother interactions with the app.

<br>

**🔹 Task 2: Track the Delivery & Access to the Chatbot**

**1️⃣ User 1** <br>
The usability problem identified is users have to check manually if they received their compensation voucher. This extra step causes some users to not even realize the voucher has been issued, making them miss the benefits. Therefore, a more seamless experience is needed to ensure users are immediately aware of their compensation without having to go looking for it.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to add an automatic pop-up confirmation that appears as soon as the voucher is successfully credited. This allows the user to get instant feedback without needing to manually verify and reduce frustration.User can click the “check for details” button to check for the details of this voucher such as expiration date and terms and condition.  

<br>

**2️⃣ User 2** <br>
The usability problem identified is related to the AI chatbot, which the user found that AI chatbot only provides automated responses. The user expressed a preference for real-time support from a human agent, especially when facing more complex or personalized queries. This indicates that while the chatbot serves basic functions, it may not fully meet the support expectations of users who require more dynamic interaction.

To solve this problem, a hybrid chatbot system will be introduced which includes the option to switch the conversations to a live customer support agent while needed. This allows the chatbot to handle common or repetitive questions and give users the opportunity to connect with a human for more complex concerns.

<br>

**3️⃣ User 3** <br>
The usability issue observed in the order tracking interface for the restaurant owner is the lack of clear instructions or navigation cues to inform merchants that they can tap on the order box to track the rider’s location and access to the chatbot. For first-time users especially, this functionality may not be immediately obvious, leading to confusion or missed interactions. 

To address this, it is recommended to include a brief guiding text such as “Details” and incorporate an arrow icon alongside to indicate interactivity. This enhancement would help users intuitively understand how to access real-time delivery tracking, improving the overall user experience.

<br>

**🔹 Task 3: Upload Menu & Apply Promotion**

**3️⃣ User 3** <br>
The usability problem identified during the observation is that the buttons in the “Type of Food” section are too small, making it difficult for users to click or tap accurately, especially on mobile devices or for users with accessibility needs. This can lead to frustration and decreased efficiency when interacting with the system. 

To nip this problem, it is recommended to increase the button size. According to Apple Human Interface Guidelines, a button needs a hit region of at least 44x44 pixels to ensure that people can select it easily(Figure 6.3.1.1). Moreover, integrating clear visual feedback such as color changes when hover or border highlights when selected can significantly improve the user experience by providing the immediate confirmation that an action has been successfully performed.



### ✅ Conclusion

Through user testing and direct observation, we identified several usability improvements. The prototype successfully supported the three main tasks, but refinements in icon usage, touch targets, and chatbot interaction are needed to enhance the overall user experience for the UTM community.
