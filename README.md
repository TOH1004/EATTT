## 👩‍💻 Meet Team EATTT

We are **EATTT**, a dynamic team of five tech enthusiasts: **E**velyn, **A**ngela, **T**an Xin Tian, **T**eoh Xin Yee, and **T**oh Shee Thong. Our team name is a unique acronym made by combining the **first letters of our names**, representing the spirit of unity, creativity, and collaboration.

Although it might look like we're all about food (we know what you're thinking!), **EATTT** is actually a symbol of how we "consume" challenges and "digest" innovative solutions. Each letter stands for a member who's bringing their own flavor of skills and ideas into this project — working together, learning together, and building something great.

Stay tuned — we’re cooking up something awesome (okay, maybe just a tiny food pun 😄)!
