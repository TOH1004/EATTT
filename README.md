> 📢 **Update Notice (1 July 2025):**  
> We've updated our project **Phase 4** here !  


## 👩‍💻 Meet Team EATTT

We are **EATTT**, a dynamic team of five tech enthusiasts: **E**velyn, **A**ngela, **T**an Xin Tian, **T**eoh Xin Yee, and **T**oh Shee Thong. Our team name is a unique acronym made by combining the **first letters of our names**, representing the spirit of unity, creativity, and collaboration.

Although it might look like we're all about food (we know what you're thinking!), **EATTT** is actually a symbol of how we "consume" challenges and "digest" innovative solutions. Each letter stands for a member who's bringing their own flavor of skills and ideas into this project — working together, learning together, and building something great.

Stay tuned — we’re cooking up something awesome (okay, maybe just a tiny food pun 😄)!

- Lack of Dietary Filtering Options

**💡Our Proposed Solutions:**
- Detailed Promotion Filter
- Interface Improvements for Voucher Visibility
- Enhanced Chatbot Accessibility and Intelligent Support Interface
- Dedicated dietary filters

**👨‍🏫Target Users**
- UTM Students
- UTM Staff
- Restaurant Owners in Arked UTM <br>
<br>

### 📊 Phase 2 – User Analysis and Task Analysis

As part of the second phase, we conducted **persona development**, **scenario-based analysis**, and **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)** to understand real-world user pain points.

 **🔎 Personas**

- **Benny (Student)**: Prioritizes promotions and speed. Struggles with missing voucher info and unclear promotions.  
- **Dr. Aisha (Lecturer)**: Needs verified halal vegetarian food but faces trouble due to the lack of dietary filters.  
- **Puan Siti (Vendor)**: Wants to promote her food effectively, but her offers and dietary tags don’t display properly.

**📌 Core Tasks Analyzed**

1. **Order Food** 
   - Manual scrolling to find deals  
   - No upfront voucher validation  
   - No combined filters (e.g., halal + vegetarian)

2. **Monitor and Manage Order Status**  
   - Delayed or vague updates  
   - Ineffective support chatbot  
   - Deeply buried help functions

3. **Upload Menu (Vendor)**  
   - No dietary tags like "vegetarian"  
   - Promotion bugs cause dish visibility loss  
   - Unclear or ineffective technical support

🧠 **Key Findings**

- Filtering and promotion tools are inefficient for users in a rush  
- Help functions and chatbot are inaccessible and unresponsive  
- Vendors are frustrated by system limitations and bugs  
- Lack of dietary options directly affects food selection and vendor sales


 🎯 **Proposed Design Requirements**

To improve usability for both customers and vendors, we propose:

- ✅ **Smart filters**: Combine tags like halal + vegetarian + under RM10  
- ✅ **Voucher clarity**: Preview usable vouchers before checkout  
- ✅ **Persistent and contextual help**: Help button available on every screen    
- ✅ **Structured vendor tagging**: Add dietary and deal-related tags during upload  
- ✅ **Stable promotions**: Ensure promoted items are visible and trackable  
- ✅ **Transparent tracking**: Real-time rider status and detailed delay reasons

### 🍱Phase 4 - Prototyping and Evaluation
In this phase, we built a high-fidelity prototype of the **EATTT** food delivery application using **Figma**, targeting the UTM community. We conducted usability testing with 3 users (a student, a lecturer, and a restaurant owner) and evaluated how well the system supports:

1. 🔍 Filtering and ordering food  
2. 🚚 Monitoring order status and contacting support  
3. 📤 Uploading menu items and applying promotions  

Testing sessions were recorded using screen-capture tools, and feedback was collected for analysis.

<br>

**🔗 Figma Prototype**

<br>

**🎯 Tasks for User Testing**

| Task | Description | Video Recordings |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Task 1** | Apply filters such as “Free delivery”, “Halal” + “Vegetarian”, and order food from Lemon Tree | 👤 [Student - Task 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kIik5BtDcBYRnNRgFVNm_vMzGGvLyS45/view?usp=drive_link) <br> 👩‍🏫 [Lecturer - Task 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-z84wQiRaMQH_1QMYz7C_YdWIYEvh7V/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Task 2** | Track order delivery and use chatbot for support | 👤 [Student - Task 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kB80HBB2XmwqP4TKDEH9UJWNXGOary4p/view?usp=drive_link) <br> 👩‍🏫 [Lecturer - Task 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2rXtgED994lNodQ9uwrwWkVxHK_9dHB/view?usp=drive_link) <br> 🍴 [Restaurant Owner - Task 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lNB01_rfl4s1vr3UUL1UV470LS2-xWYh/view?usp=drivesdk) |
| **Task 3** | Upload a new menu item and apply promotions | 🍴 [Restaurant Owner - Task 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kJMXOlv3ebxv1pB1k3ioCX5ybgq6SDYq/view?pli=1) |

<br>

**🔍 Key Observations & Issues**

**🔹 Task 1: Filtering & Ordering**
- ✅ Users liked dietary filters and voucher preview
- ⚠️ Confusing filter icon (suggest using funnel icon)
- ⚠️ Small "Add" button in menu (hard to tap)

**🔹 Task 2: Delivery Tracking & Chatbot**
- ✅ Chatbot button is easy to access
- ⚠️ No auto confirmation for vouchers (suggest pop-up)
- ⚠️ AI chatbot only gives auto-replies (suggest hybrid with human support)
- ⚠️ No clear cue that order box is clickable for tracking

**🔹 Task 3: Menu Upload & Promotion**
- ✅ Promotion page with "Select All" is user-friendly
- ⚠️ Type selection buttons too small (not touch-friendly)

<br>

**🧠 Summary of Usability Recommendations**

| Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| 🔘 Icon misuse | Replace "filter" icon with funnel symbol and label |
| ➕ Button size | Increase "Add" and type selection buttons to at least 44x44px |
| 📦 Voucher | Auto popup when compensation is given |
| 💬 Chatbot | Add hybrid option to escalate to live agent |
| 🚚 Tracking cue | Add tooltip or icon to show that order box is interactive (e.g., “Tap here to track your rider”) or include a map pin with arrow to indicate interactivity |
<br>

**✅ Conclusion**

Through user testing and direct observation, we identified several usability improvements. The prototype successfully supported the three main tasks, but refinements in icon usage, touch targets, and chatbot interaction are needed to enhance the overall user experience for the UTM community.
