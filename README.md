## 👩‍💻 Meet Team EATTT

We are **EATTT**, a dynamic team of five tech enthusiasts: **E**velyn, **A**ngela, **T**an Xin Tian, **T**eoh Xin Yee, and **T**oh Shee Thong. Our team name is a unique acronym made by combining the **first letters of our names**, representing the spirit of unity, creativity, and collaboration.

Although it might look like we're all about food (we know what you're thinking!), **EATTT** is actually a symbol of how we "consume" challenges and "digest" innovative solutions. Each letter stands for a member who's bringing their own flavor of skills and ideas into this project — working together, learning together, and building something great.

Stay tuned — we’re cooking up something awesome (okay, maybe just a tiny food pun 😄)!

- Ineffective Chatbot Accessibility and Responsiveness in User Support
- Lack of Dietary Filtering Options

**💡Our Proposed Solutions:**
- Detailed Promotion Filter
- Interface Improvements for Voucher Visibility
- Enhanced Chatbot Accessibility and Intelligent Support Interface
- Dedicated dietary filters

**👨‍🏫Target Users**
- UTM Students
- UTM Staff

### 📊 Phase 2 – User Analysis and Task Analysis

As part of the second phase, we conducted **persona development**, **scenario-based analysis**, and **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)** to understand real-world user pain points.

 **🔎 Personas**

- **Benny (Student)**: Prioritizes promotions and speed. Struggles with missing voucher info and unclear promotions.  
- **Dr. Aisha (Lecturer)**: Needs verified halal vegetarian food but faces trouble due to the lack of dietary filters.  
- **Puan Siti (Vendor)**: Wants to promote her food effectively, but her offers and dietary tags don’t display properly.

**📌 Core Tasks Analyzed**

1. **Order Food** 
   - Manual scrolling to find deals  
   - No upfront voucher validation  
   - No combined filters (e.g., halal + vegetarian)

2. **Monitor and Manage Order Status**  
   - Delayed or vague updates  
   - Ineffective support chatbot  
   - Deeply buried help functions

3. **Upload Menu (Vendor)**  
   - No dietary tags like "vegetarian"  
   - Promotion bugs cause dish visibility loss  
   - Unclear or ineffective technical support

🧠 **Key Findings**

- Filtering and promotion tools are inefficient for users in a rush  
- Help functions and chatbot are inaccessible and unresponsive  
- Vendors are frustrated by system limitations and bugs  
- Lack of dietary options directly affects food selection and vendor sales


 🎯 **Proposed Design Requirements**

To improve usability for both customers and vendors, we propose:

- ✅ **Smart filters**: Combine tags like halal + vegetarian + under RM10  
- ✅ **Voucher clarity**: Preview usable vouchers before checkout  
- ✅ **Persistent and contextual help**: Help button available on every screen    
- ✅ **Structured vendor tagging**: Add dietary and deal-related tags during upload  
- ✅ **Stable promotions**: Ensure promoted items are visible and trackable  
- ✅ **Transparent tracking**: Real-time rider status and detailed delay reasons
