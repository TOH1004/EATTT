## 👩‍💻 Meet Team EATTT

We are **EATTT**, a dynamic team of five tech enthusiasts: **E**velyn, **A**ngela, **T**an Xin Tian, **T**eoh Xin Yee, and **T**oh Shee Thong. Our team name is a unique acronym made by combining the **first letters of our names**, representing the spirit of unity, creativity, and collaboration.

Although it might look like we're all about food (we know what you're thinking!), **EATTT** is actually a symbol of how we "consume" challenges and "digest" innovative solutions. Each letter stands for a member who's bringing their own flavor of skills and ideas into this project — working together, learning together, and building something great.

Stay tuned — we’re cooking up something awesome (okay, maybe just a tiny food pun 😄)!

### 📊 Phase 2 – User Analysis and Task Analysis

As part of the second phase, we conducted persona development, scenario-based analysis, and Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) to understand real-world user pain points.

 🔎 Personas

- Benny (Student): Prioritizes promotions and speed. Struggles with missing voucher info and unclear promotions.  
- Dr. Aisha (Lecturer): Needs verified halal vegetarian food but faces trouble due to the lack of dietary filters.  
- Puan Siti (Vendor): Wants to promote her food effectively, but her offers and dietary tags don’t display properly.

📌 Core Tasks Analyzed

1. Order Food  
   - Manual scrolling to find deals  
   - No upfront voucher validation  
   - No combined filters (e.g., halal + vegetarian)

2. Monitor and Manage Order Status  
   - Delayed or vague updates  
   - Ineffective support chatbot  
   - Deeply buried help functions

3. Upload Menu (Vendor)  
   - No dietary tags like "vegetarian"  
   - Promotion bugs cause dish visibility loss  
   - Unclear or ineffective technical support

🧠 Key Findings

- Filtering and promotion tools are inefficient for users in a rush  
- Help functions and chatbot are inaccessible and unresponsive  
- Vendors are frustrated by system limitations and bugs  
- Lack of dietary options directly affects food selection and vendor sales


 🎯 Proposed Design Requirements

To improve usability for both customers and vendors, we propose:

- ✅ Smart filters: Combine tags like halal + vegetarian + under RM10  
- ✅ Voucher clarity: Preview usable vouchers before checkout  
- ✅ Persistent and contextual help: Help button available on every screen    
- ✅ Structured vendor tagging: Add dietary and deal-related tags during upload  
- ✅ Stable promotions: Ensure promoted items are visible and trackable  
- ✅ Transparent tracking: Real-time rider status and detailed delay reasons
